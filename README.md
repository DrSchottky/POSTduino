Basic Arduino(AVR)-based POST signal sniffer/logger for XBOX 360.
I think that this first release works only with ATMEGA328P/168(Uno/Duemilanove), because i use direct port access (insted of digitalRead()) to read pin inputs.
Maybe a multiplatform version will be release in future.Or , if u want, make it yourself!

Schematics are in the .fcd file, but it's a simple logic level shifter.

Requires FULL POST, and i tested it only on a FAT rev.

Remeber to join the masses.
